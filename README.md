# MarlinRoboDrip

##What is the RoboDrip
[RoboDrip](https://www.c-able.ne.jp/~hirai551/cbot/) is NC(Numerical Control) coffee maker, drived by the [RepRap](https://github.com/reprap) technology. This firmaware is a very old fork from [Marlin Firmaware](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin), so the original version is not sure, and additional features are:
-Water level sensing is added.
--Instead of the extruder axis, RoboDrip uses it as water pump feeding. The water level sensing is used to stop water feeding into the boiling bottle.
